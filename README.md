Analyzing New York City Motor Vehicle Collisions


In this project, we analyze motor vehicle collisions in New York City (NYC) to:

Understand the magnitude of the problem they represent
Determine when and where collisions occur
Make it easier to see where serious collisions (collisions with deaths and injuries) are occurring
Suggest causes and interventions to investigate
Highlight problematic locations and areas that may not be obvious
